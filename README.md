# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This Kata was originally written in C# by Terry Hughes and later translated to Java by Emily Bache. I forked it from [her GitHub](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) on 2021-09-23.

I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see [the TextTests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests))

## What I wanted to achieve

Focusing only on the Java version of the Kata, I wanted to re-formulate the code using the latest Java 17 JDK
and language features. I am not so much interested in the machanics of testing, but much more in succint and elegant 
code as well as consistency (in language and logic) between code, tests and requirements.

## Better Code Hub

The original score of the code on [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com/) was 5/10: ![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata?branch=master)

I am curious which score my solution will yield, but it is not my goal to maximize it.
